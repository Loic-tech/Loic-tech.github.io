      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
          I am strongly interested in Macroeconomics, particularly in Public Finance, International Trade,
          and Climate Change. My expertise also includes Applied Econometrics, particularly using advanced
          causal inference techniques to address complex economic issues

          These cutting-edge methodologies allow me to analyze complex economic issues.
          By combining data analysis and Economic theory, I aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of economic phenomena and their policy implications.

          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 25px;">
            This paper studies the impact of a new Balanced Budget rule (BBR) on economic growth adopted in Switzerland’s constitution in 2003. Its distinctive feature is that the government deficit limit
            is flexible depending on the comparison between real and potential GDP, unlike the traditional fixed 3% deficit limit in the European Union. First, using a synthetic control method,
            I document that from 2003 to 2018, the BBR adoption has been associated with an average annual growth rate of 0.95% in Switzerland. Second, I build an endogenous growth model with a shortsighted
            government making inefficient decisions. I find that by reducing public debt, the BBR tempers the "crowding-out effect of debt" and frees up resources for private investment in R&D. Additionally,
            by reducing the service of the debt, it frees up resources for public investment in R&D. These investments, in turn, foster economic growth. Third, the model calibrated to Switzerland shows that
            the long-term yearly growth effect of the new BBR is 1.27 basis points, which compounds to a 1% GDP gain after 10 years. Furthermore, compared to traditional BBRs, which reduce welfare,
            the new BBR increases it, providing a rationale for the lack of enforcement of traditional BBRs.

          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            In this paper, we first document that climatic or political shocks in an origin country (or exporting country) affect inflation in the destination country (its importing partner)
            through trade among African countries. Second, we demonstrate that existing Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) in Africa have significantly increased trade by 62 to 77 percent from
            1995 to 2019. These figures are lower than most estimates in the literature. We address several issues related to estimating the effects of RTAs, namely the selection bias due to
            many zeros in trade data, their staggered adoption feature, and their heterogeneous effects across regions. To deal with these issues, we apply a structural gravity model, a Pseudo Poisson
            Maximum Likelihood (PPML) method, and a state-of-the-art event study. Third, after showing evidence that trade transmits shocks and that RTAs significantly
            increase trade, we develop a theoretical model to discuss the broader implications of regional trade agreements for monetary policy. We use the model to explore how the African
            Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), adopted in 2021, could affect countries' inflation and its implications for their monetary policy.

              The purpose of the AfCFTA is to reduce trade barriers for greater integration between African countries. WAEMU, having historically had its main trading partners outside Africa, will have to trade more within the
              continent. This paper identifies African countries with which WAEMU could increase its trade, and studies the implications of such an increase on macroeconomic stability, before proposing a monetary policy
              orientation to minimize the impact of external shocks. To do so, we develop a new approach to detect the trade expansion potential between two economies. This approach, applied to WAEMU countries using
              the Harmonized System’s detailed four-digit product classification, over the period 1996 to 2016, reveals that South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia, Kenya, and Ghana are the countries with the highest
              potential for trade expansion with WAEMU. With the AfCFTA, WAEMU could increase its imports by more than 12% on average with each of the African partners listed above. This figure reaches 32% for South Africa,
              the first potential partner. Using a new Keynesian model in an open economy, calibrated to WAEMU, we simulate several trade integration scenarios, targeted at the partners identified above. We find that greater
              integration with these countries will increase the transmission of price and production shocks from African partners to WAEMU economy. BCEAO within a framework of an optimal monetary policy should, in addition
              to inflation, react more to variations in the effective nominal exchange rate. Based on these results, the paper makes some recommendations for trade and monetary policies.
